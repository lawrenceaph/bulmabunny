Hugo, my preferred site generator, supports Markdown, a beautiful markup language that's been around since 2004.

I **love** Markdown. It is simple. It is beautiful. It is intuitive (once you get the hang of some fundamentals).

It's gotten so bad that I now have several Markdown editors on my devices, and I wouldn't mind more. I use **[Caret](https://caret.io/)**, **[Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/)**, **[Nota](https://nota.md/)**, and **[SimpleNote](https://simplenote.com/)**. Caret is nice because it is available on both Windows and MacOs, and it is gorgeous. Just look at its beautiful preview mode:

## Markdown Resources

Two resources that really helped me get some footing in Markdown were by Matt Cone. I started by reading his [book](https://www.markdownguide.org/book/), and in the beginning I would constantly check his site, the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/), as a quick reference. If you don't want to spend, the Markdown Guide (site) is a sufficient resource. I acquired the book as a way to thank Matt for the great work he's been doing. It's well written and a quick read, too. Lots of value.

## Quick Credit to Markdown's Creators

Markdown originated in 2004 from the efforts of John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. I wanted to mention them, as they created something quite breathtaking, and they deserve credit for it.

## Many Flavors and Much to Learn

There are a lot of Markdown flavors and extended syntax, for advanced features. I'm still learning these, but as with many things, you only need to know a few basic things about Markdown to start enjoying it.

Do you use Markdown? What's your favorite editor?
